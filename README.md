# Infinite Freddy Time

A small python script that gives you unlimited battery time in [Five Night at Freddy's: Security Breach](https://store.steampowered.com/app/747660/Five_Nights_at_Freddys_Security_Breach/). It works by writing directly into the game's memory, and resetting the battery countdown timer every five seconds. The memory offset of this counter was reverse engineered with Cheat Engine 7.3, all relevant files can be found under the `CE` folder.
